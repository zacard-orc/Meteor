Meteor
======

A monitor style just like meteor, it can be used for data stream based on vector or data package.I write it by FlashAS3.
 

Interface Tutorial
======

function Afun_001(PARA1:Number,PARA2:Number,PARA3:Number):int
PARA1 is the destination domain.You can captuer the domain name like 'http://www.yahoo.com'
PARA2 is the color of meteor.You can decide the color accoding to the page response time.
PARA3 is the number of page response time.

The ball(meteor) will move ,once there is a page response activity input.The start point you can describe just as Client IP and you can classify the Client IP ahead bit or last bit into different ball start point.
The ost parameter you can set is for the speed of meteor movement.
Usually,the flash is based on 24FPS.The more FPS set , the faster the ball is moving.

I get the inspiration from Tmall(www.taobao.com) 11Â·11 promotion.In T.V,you'll see his monitor screen like this.
I renew all the style and used in the CMCC/Shanghai IT department to monitor all CRM T2T page response.
